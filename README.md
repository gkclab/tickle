silicon starter project

as compared to the FCI project, the "project" nature of this is still under development.
The current resources are:

- PW.py, which is a working example code to reproduce the bandgap of Si (credit: Narbe Mardirossian). 

- notes.pdf, which are a few brief slides about the code

- mq.pdf, which is a long set of lecture notes that was originally used to write PW.py
